# Version Control

Version control, also known as **source control**, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

Version control systems are software tools that enable software teams to:

- **Track Changes**: Monitor the history of changes to the source code.
- **Collaborate**: Work on the same codebase with other developers without conflicts.
- **Maintain Versions**: Roll back to previous versions if needed, ensuring code stability.

By using version control, teams can streamline development processes, improve collaboration, and ensure the integrity of the codebase over time.


# Difference Between Git and GitHub


| Feature         | **Git**                                                  | **GitHub**                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code. | GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. |
| **Purpose**      | Helps developers track changes, collaborate locally, and manage versions of the code. | Provides a collaborative environment to share, review, and manage Git repositories online. |
| **Usage**        | Operates on your local machine (command-line interface or GUI tools). | Accessible via a web interface, desktop apps, or CLI for remote repository management. |
| **Hosting**      | Does not provide hosting; purely a version control tool. | Provides hosting, issue tracking, pull requests, and other project management features. |
| **Example**      | Git commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`.       | GitHub features: Pull Requests, Actions, Wikis, and Discussions. |

# Difference Between `git fetch` and `git pull`

| Command         | **git fetch**                                          | **git pull**                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Downloads updates (commits, branches, tags) from the remote repository without modifying the working directory or current branch. | Downloads updates from the remote repository and immediately merges them into the current branch. |
| **Purpose**      | To view changes in the remote repository before deciding to integrate them. | To update the local repository and working directory with changes from the remote repository. |
| **Workflow**     | Requires an additional step (e.g., `git merge`) to incorporate changes into the working directory. | Combines fetching and merging in a single command. |
| **Example Use Case** | Ideal when you want to review updates before merging. | Useful when you want to quickly sync your branch with the remote. |
| **Command**      | `git fetch origin`                                   | `git pull origin`                                   |

### Summary:
- Use **`git fetch`** when you want to see what’s new in the remote repository without affecting your current branch.  
- Use **`git pull`** when you’re ready to update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote.  


# Explaining `git rebase`

`git rebase` is a Git command used to integrate changes from one branch into another in a cleaner way compared to merging.

### In Simple Terms:
Imagine two branches:  
- `main` (the primary branch).  
- `develop` (where you're working on new changes as in the case of this work).  

When you use `git rebase`, it takes all the changes from the `develop` branch and "replays" them on top of the `main` branch. This creates a linear, cleaner history without merge commits.  

### Why Use `git rebase`?
- To keep the commit history clean and easy to understand.  
- To avoid unnecessary merge commits.  

### Command:
To rebase your `feature` branch onto `main`, use:  
```bash
git checkout feature  
git rebase main
