# Version Control

Version control, also known as **source control**, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

Version control systems are software tools that enable software teams to:

- **Track Changes**: Monitor the history of changes to the source code.
- **Collaborate**: Work on the same codebase with other developers without conflicts.
- **Maintain Versions**: Roll back to previous versions if needed, ensuring code stability.

By using version control, teams can streamline development processes, improve collaboration, and ensure the integrity of the codebase over time.
