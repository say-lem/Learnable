# Version Control

Version control, also known as **source control**, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

Version control systems are software tools that enable software teams to:

- **Track Changes**: Monitor the history of changes to the source code.
- **Collaborate**: Work on the same codebase with other developers without conflicts.
- **Maintain Versions**: Roll back to previous versions if needed, ensuring code stability.

By using version control, teams can streamline development processes, improve collaboration, and ensure the integrity of the codebase over time.


# Difference Between Git and GitHub

While Git and GitHub are closely related, they serve different purposes in the software development workflow.

| Feature         | **Git**                                                  | **GitHub**                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code. | GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. |
| **Purpose**      | Helps developers track changes, collaborate locally, and manage versions of the code. | Provides a collaborative environment to share, review, and manage Git repositories online. |
| **Usage**        | Operates on your local machine (command-line interface or GUI tools). | Accessible via a web interface, desktop apps, or CLI for remote repository management. |
| **Hosting**      | Does not provide hosting; purely a version control tool. | Provides hosting, issue tracking, pull requests, and other project management features. |
| **Example**      | Git commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`.       | GitHub features: Pull Requests, Actions, Wikis, and Discussions. |

In summary, **Git** is the tool used for version control, while **GitHub** enhances Git by providing a collaborative platform for code hosting and management.
